## Write the Docs Best Practices (Remove this section before publishing)

**How-To Principles**:
- ✅ Goal-oriented: Solve a specific problem
- ✅ Assume reader has basic knowledge (not for beginners)
- ✅ Focus on practical steps, minimal theory
- ✅ Flexible: Reader can adapt to their situation
- ✅ Provide options and alternatives for different scenarios
- ✅ Include troubleshooting for common issues
- ✅ Link to Reference for details, Explanation for "why"
- ✅ Use imperative mood ("Do this", not "You might want to")

**Accessibility**:
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy
- ✅ Alt text for all images
- ✅ Clear, plain language
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- ✅ Descriptive link text

**Inclusivity**:
- ✅ Diverse examples
- ✅ Gender-neutral language
- ✅ No cultural assumptions

**How-To Specific Guidelines**:
- Start with the goal (what will be accomplished)
- Provide quick summary for experienced users
- Offer options and variations (real-world scenarios vary)
- Include verification step (how to know it worked)
- Troubleshoot common problems
- Don't explain concepts - link to Explanations
- Assume familiarity - not a tutorial
