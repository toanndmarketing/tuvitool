## Write the Docs Best Practices (Remove this section before publishing)

**Explanation Principles**:
- ✅ Understanding-oriented: Clarify and illuminate
- ✅ Discuss concepts, not tasks (not instructional)
- ✅ Provide context and background
- ✅ Explain "why" things are the way they are
- ✅ Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
- ✅ Make connections between ideas
- ✅ Can be more free-form than other types
- ✅ No imperative mood (not "do this")

**Accessibility**:
- ✅ Proper heading hierarchy
- ✅ Alt text for diagrams (especially important for conceptual diagrams)
- ✅ Clear language, define technical terms
- ✅ Use diagrams to clarify complex concepts
- ✅ Descriptive link text

**Inclusivity**:
- ✅ Diverse examples
- ✅ Gender-neutral language
- ✅ No cultural assumptions
- ✅ Consider different learning styles (visual, verbal, etc.)

**Explanation-Specific Guidelines**:
- Start with "why" before "what"
- Use analogies and metaphors to clarify
- Diagrams are very valuable for explanations
- Discuss design decisions and trade-offs
- Address common misconceptions
- Make connections to related concepts
- Don't just describe - explain and clarify
- Be conversational but accurate
