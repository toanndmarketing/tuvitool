# Feature Specification: Documentation Project - [PROJECT NAME]
<!-- Replace [PROJECT NAME] with the confirmed friendly title generated during /spec-kitty.specify. -->

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Mission**: documentation
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Documentation Scope

**Iteration Mode**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: initial | gap-filling | feature-specific]
**Target Audience**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: developers integrating library | end users | contributors | operators]
**Selected Divio Types**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which of tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation?]
**Languages Detected**: [Auto-detected during planning - JavaScript, Python, Rust, etc.]
**Generators to Use**: [Based on languages - JSDoc, Sphinx, rustdoc]

### Gap Analysis Results *(for gap-filling mode only)*

**Existing Documentation**:
- [List current docs and their Divio types]
- Example: `README.md` - explanation (partial)
- Example: `API.md` - reference (outdated)

**Identified Gaps**:
- [Missing Divio types or outdated content]
- Example: No tutorial for getting started
- Example: Reference docs don't cover new v2 API

**Coverage Percentage**: [X%] *(calculated from gap analysis)*

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Documentation user stories focus on DOCUMENTATION CONSUMERS.
  Each story should be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE type of documentation,
  it should still deliver value to a specific audience.

  Prioritize by user impact: Which documentation will help the most users accomplish their goals?
-->

### User Story 1 - [Documentation Consumer Need] (Priority: P1)

[Describe who needs the documentation and what they want to accomplish]

**Why this priority**: [Explain value - e.g., "New users can't adopt the library without a tutorial"]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify documentation achieves the goal]
- Example: "New developer with no prior knowledge can complete getting-started tutorial in under 15 minutes"

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [user's starting state], **When** [they read/follow this documentation], **Then** [they accomplish their goal]
2. **Given** [documentation exists], **When** [user searches for information], **Then** [they find it within X clicks]

---

### User Story 2 - [Documentation Consumer Need] (Priority: P2)

[Describe the second most important documentation need]

**Why this priority**: [Explain value]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Documentation Consumer Need] (Priority: P3)

[Describe the third most important documentation need]

**Why this priority**: [Explain value]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when documentation becomes outdated after code changes?
- How do users find information that doesn't fit standard Divio types?
- What if generated documentation conflicts with manually-written documentation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Documentation Content

- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST include [tutorial | how-to | reference | explanation] for [feature/area]
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST be accessible (proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, clear language)
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST use bias-free language and inclusive examples
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST provide working code examples for all key use cases

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST cover [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which features? all public APIs? core features only?]

#### Generation Requirements *(if using generators)*

- **FR-006**: System MUST generate API reference from [JSDoc comments | Python docstrings | Rust doc comments]
- **FR-007**: Generated documentation MUST integrate seamlessly with manually-written documentation
- **FR-008**: Generator configuration MUST be version-controlled and reproducible

#### Gap-Filling Requirements *(if gap-filling mode)*

- **FR-009**: Gap analysis MUST identify missing Divio types across all documentation areas
- **FR-010**: Gap analysis MUST detect API reference docs that are outdated compared to current code
- **FR-011**: System MUST prioritize gaps by user impact (critical, high, medium, low)

### Key Entities

- **Divio Documentation Type**: One of tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation - each with distinct purpose and characteristics
- **Documentation Generator**: Tool that creates reference documentation from code comments (JSDoc for JavaScript, Sphinx for Python, rustdoc for Rust)
- **Gap Analysis**: Assessment identifying missing or outdated documentation, with coverage metrics
- **Documentation Template**: Structured template following Divio principles for a specific documentation type

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can find information they need within [X] clicks/searches
- **SC-002**: Documentation passes accessibility checks (proper heading hierarchy, alt text for images, clear language)
- **SC-003**: API reference is [X]% complete (all public APIs documented)
- **SC-004**: [X]% of users successfully complete tasks using documentation alone (measure via user testing)
- **SC-005**: Documentation build completes with zero warnings or errors

### Quality Gates

- All images have descriptive alt text
- Heading hierarchy is proper (H1 → H2 → H3, no skipping levels)
- No broken links (internal or external)
- All code examples have been tested and work
- Spelling and grammar are correct

## Assumptions

- **ASM-001**: Project has code comments/docstrings for reference generation to be valuable
- **ASM-002**: Users are willing to maintain documentation alongside code changes
- **ASM-003**: Documentation will be hosted on [platform] using [static site generator]
- **ASM-004**: Target audience has [technical background level] and familiarity with [technologies]

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this documentation project:

- Documentation hosting/deployment infrastructure (generates source files only)
- Documentation analytics and metrics collection (page views, search queries, time on page)
- AI-powered content generation (templates have placeholders, but content is human-written)
- Interactive documentation features (try-it-now API consoles, code playgrounds, live demos)
- Automatic documentation updates when code changes (manual maintenance required)
- Translation/localization to other languages
- Video tutorials or screencasts
- PDF or print-optimized formats (unless explicitly requested)

## Constraints

- Documentation must be maintained as code changes
- Generated documentation is only as good as code comments
- Static site generators have limitations on interactivity
- Some documentation types (tutorials especially) require significant manual effort
- Documentation must remain accurate - outdated docs are worse than no docs
